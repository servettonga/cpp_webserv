Passing the test here is the minimum before going to an evaluation.

THIS TEST IS NOT MEANT TO BE THE ONLY TEST IN THE EVALUATION!!!

Before starting please follow the next few steps
(files content can be anything and will be shown to you by the test):
- Download the cgi_test executable on the host
- Create a directory YoupiBanane with:
	-a file name youpi.bad_extension
	-a file name youpi.bla
	-a sub directory called nop
		-a file name youpi.bad_extension in nop
		-a file name other.pouic in nop
	-a sub directory called Yeah
		-a file name not_happy.bad_extension in Yeah

Setup the configuration file as follow:
- / must answer to GET request ONLY
- /put_test/* must answer to PUT request and save files to a directory of your choice
- any file with .bla as extension must answer to POST request by calling the cgi_test executable
- /post_body must answer anything to POST request with a maxBody of 100
- /directory/ must answer to GET request and the root of it would be the repository YoupiBanane
and if no file are requested, it should search for youpi.bad_extension files
