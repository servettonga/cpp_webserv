# Key points:

1. Network Settings:
    - Host and port for server binding
    - Server names for virtual hosting support

2. Default Server Settings:
    - Root directory
    - Default index file
    - Client timeout
    - Maximum body size

3. Location Blocks:
    - Path-specific configurations
    - Method restrictions
    - Directory listing options
    - CGI settings per location

4. CGI Configuration:
    - File extension to handler mapping
    - Path configurations for CGI executables

5. Error Pages:
    - Custom error page mapping
    - Default error pages

This configuration structure allows for:
- Virtual hosting
- Path-specific configurations
- CGI support
- Custom error pages
- Request size limits
- Directory listing control

The configuration would typically be populated by parsing a configuration file (like nginx-style config) using the ConfigParser class.
